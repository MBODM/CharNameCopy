# CharNameCopy
A tiny World of Warcraft Addon to copy character names (written in LUA)

This addon opens a popup window, which includes the target's player name as highlighted text. Just press CTRL+C to copy that text to clipboard. Helps with searching players in armory and stuff like that, especially for those players having all that horrible chars in their name :)

Usage is very simple:

  /cnc show  (to show the window, with your target's name)
  /cnc hide  (to hide the window, i.e. when using a macro)

Have fun.
