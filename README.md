# CharNameCopy
A tiny World of Warcraft Addon to copy character names (written in LUA)

This addon opens a popup window, which includes the target's player name as highlighted text. Just press CTRL+C to copy that text to clipboard. Helps with searching players in armory and stuff like that. Especially for international players, or those players having all that horrible chars in their name :)

Usage is very simple:

To show the window (with your target's name) -> /cnc show

To hide the window (i.e. when using a macro) -> /cnc hide

Have fun.
